# Project Setup

- Download the all the code files from the this [link](https://github.com/eva5covergence/EVA5_AI_Projects_new/tree/master/MultiObjectiveModel_YMPNet_Pavan) to your root folder.
- Additionaly download the pre-trained weights from the location [best.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dA7sYTDQtDvBgW-1QpjV3jWPQA9p-yZR/view?usp=sharing) 
- Create a folder called "test_inputs" and place a input image in this folder. 
- Create two folders called depth_outs and yolo_outs.
- Run the code in the notebook [session15_predictions.ipynb](https://github.com/eva5covergence/EVA5_AI_Projects_new/blob/master/MultiObjectiveModel_YMPNet_Pavan/session15_predictions.ipynb)
- The bounding box predications output is placed in the folder yolo_outs and Depth map image is placed in the folder depth_outs.
