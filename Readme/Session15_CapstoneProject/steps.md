# Project Setup

- Download the all the code files from the this [link](https://github.com/eva5covergence/Ezhirko) to your root folder.
- Additionaly download the pre-trained weights from the location [best.pt](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ZrqRbZpg34x5eh92DpqzIyGdG0ZbBtj2) 
- Create a folder called "test_inputs" and place a input image in this folder. 
- Create two folders called depth_outs and yolo_outs.
- Run the code in the notebook [PPEMultiModel_Predictions.ipynb](https://github.com/eva5covergence/Ezhirko/blob/main/PPEMultiModel_Predictions.ipynb)
- The bounding box predications output is placed in the folder yolo_outs and Depth map image is placed in the folder depth_outs.
