## Sesson 15 - Create a network that can perform 3 tasks simultaneously
1.  Predict the boots, PPE, hardhat, and mask if there is an image
2.  Predict the depth map of the image
3.  Predict the Planar Surfaces in the region

Some of the biggest challenges in computer vission is to recognise and identify the objects present in the image, predict the depth between the objects in the image and identify the surface planes in a given image. For many years these task were challenging for researchers because the image seen by computer is just a array of pixel values.
