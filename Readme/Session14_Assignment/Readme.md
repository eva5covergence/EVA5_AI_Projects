### Preparation of Dataset
1. The dataset that was collected for training yolo model which contains 3590 images of people wearing Hardhat, Vest, Mask and Boots is being used in this assignment.
2. The ["Depth Estimation Repository"](https://github.com/intel-isl/MiDaS) contains pretrained model weight which we have used to convert our PPE image dataset into Depth map images.
